We hereby declare that the work we have done in this project is original and we haven't copied or plagiarised anything from anywhere.

The project webpage link is http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~anmolgarg/CS296Project.html.
The targets of the Makefile are:

make clean - This target deletes all the content generated by running other make targets.

make dist - This first does a make clean and then removes Box2D library installed and the tar zips the entire base code folder


make - This first installs Box2D lib and then compiles the src files and generates the report.

make report - generated the project report

make install - this first runs a make on the project and copies the contents for project for the end user like html file , report , plots and images to the install directory(path to which is ~/install)
